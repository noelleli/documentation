"""Initializes a DfpClient without using yaml-cached credentials.

While our LoadFromStorage method provides a useful shortcut to instantiate a
client if you regularly use just one set of credentials, production applications
may need to swap out users. This example shows you how to create an OAuth 2.0
client and a DfpClient without relying on a yaml file.
